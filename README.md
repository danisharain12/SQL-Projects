# Stack Overflow Data Analysis Using SQL

##  Project Overview
This project explores **Stack Overflow post data** using **SQL** to uncover key insights about user activity, post engagement, and knowledge-sharing patterns.  
The dataset includes **posts, comments, votes, badges, and user activity**, allowing for deep exploration of trends in the Stack Overflow community.

##  Key Findings
1️- **Top Contributors Drive Engagement** – A small percentage of users generate the majority of comments, edits, and votes.  
2️- **Badges Encourage Participation** – Common badges are easy to earn, while rare ones indicate high contributions.  
3️- **Certain Tags Attract High Scores** – Tags like `Python`, `Machine Learning`, and `Algorithms` consistently lead to high-quality posts.  
4️- **Related Questions Improve Knowledge Sharing** – Linked posts tend to receive higher engagement.  
5️- **Post Edits Correlate with Quality** – Frequently edited posts have higher scores and visibility.  
6️- **Voting Patterns Reveal Popularity Trends** – Highly viewed posts receive more votes, reinforcing the **visibility-impact relationship**.  

##  Dataset Used
The dataset includes the following key tables:  
- **posts** – Contains Stack Overflow questions and answers.  
- **comments** – User comments on posts.  
- **votes** – Tracks upvotes, downvotes, and other vote types.  
- **badges** – Shows the distribution of earned badges.  
- **post_links** – Represents relationships between related questions.  

##  SQL Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Exploration:** Filtering, sorting, aggregations (`GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`).  
- **Joins & Relationships:** Combining data from multiple tables (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`).  
- **Advanced Queries:** Using `CTEs`, `window functions`, `subqueries`, and `CASE` statements.  
- **Ranking & Trend Analysis:** Identifying top contributors, analyzing voting behavior, and tracking badge distributions.
